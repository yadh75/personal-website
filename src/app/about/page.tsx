                        Hi there, my name is
                        <span className="mx-1 font-bold">

                        </span>
                        I was born on July 7, 2005 in Bogor, then moved to
                        Bekasi and lived there.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Started programming since 2019 learning Javascript to
                        build a discord bot. After a few months, I felt
                        confident and decided to take on a new challenge by
                        learning how to create a website using html and css at
                        the end of 2020.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once I understood how to creating a website, I started
                        to experiment with other technologies such as React,
                        Next.js, and TailwindCSS to build more advanced
                        websites. Although I faced some difficulties during the
                        learning process, I remained determined and tried to
                        overcome every obstacle that came my way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Through programming, I have discovered a passion for
                        problem-solving and creative thinking, and I look
                        forward to continuing to develop my skills and knowledge
                        in this exciting field.
